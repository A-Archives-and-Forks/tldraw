## tldraw (migration branch)

This is the migration PR for the tldraw's new open source codebase.

Its job is to:

- remove all content from the first version of tldraw (which is archived at [https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-v1](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-v1))
- add a workspace for the public code from the new version's repo
