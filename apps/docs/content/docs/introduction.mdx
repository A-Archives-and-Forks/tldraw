Welcome to the tldraw developer docs.

tldraw is a React component that you can use to create infinite canvas experiences for the web. It is essentially the [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com) application wrapped up and distributed as a React component, but with powerful APIs for creating custom shapes, tools, behaviors, and user interfaces elements.

To get the very latest version, use the [latest canary release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tldraw/tldraw?activeTab=versions). Docs for the very latest version are also available at [canary.tldraw.dev](https://canary.tldraw.dev).
