The `Editor` class is the main way of controlling tldraw's editor. You can use it to manage the editor's internal state, make changes to the document, or respond to changes that occur.

By design, the `Editor`'s surface area is [very large](/gen/editor/Editor-class). Almost everything is available through it. Need to create some shapes? Use `editor.createShapes()`. Need to delete them? Use `editor.deleteShapes()`. Need a sorted array of every shape on the current page? Use `editor.sortedShapesArray`.

This page lists some common uses of the `Editor` class. For further info, check out the [Store](/docs/store) and [Events](/docs/events) pages. The full `Editor` reference is available in the [Editor API](/gen/editor/Editor-class).

## Common things to do with the editor

### Create shapes

```ts
editor.createShapes([
  {
    id,
    type: 'geo',
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    props: {
      geo: 'rectangle',
      w: 100,
      h: 100,
      dash: 'draw',
      color: 'blue',
      size: 'm',
    },
  },
])
```

### Update shapes

```ts
const shape = editor.selectedShapes[0]

editor.updateShapes([
  {
    id: shape.id, // required
    type: shape.type, // required
    x: 100,
    y: 100,
    props: {
      w: 200,
    },
  },
])
```

### Delete shapes

```ts
const shape = editor.selectedShapes[0]

editor.deleteShapes([shape.id])
```

### Get a shape by its id

```ts
editor.getShapeById(myShapeId)
```

### Move the camera

```ts
editor.setCamera(0, 0, 1)
```
