The `<Tldraw/>` component is the easiest way to get started with tldraw. It combines several lower-level libraries: the `TldrawEditor` component from `@tldraw/editor` and the `TldrawUi` component from `@tldraw/ui`.

To use the `<Tldraw/>` component, create a file like this one:

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from '@tldraw/tldraw'
import '@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function TldrawExample() {
	return (
		<div
			style={{
				position: 'fixed',
				inset: 0,
			}}
		>
			<Tldraw />
		</div>
	)
}
```

Note the imports of the two css files. 

### CSS

In order to use the `<Tldraw/>` component, you must also import CSS from the library `@tldraw/editor` library (automatically installed with `@tldraw/tldraw`):

```ts
import '@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css'
```

You can overwrite these files with other CSS, customize the styles via package patches, or copy the contents into a different file and import that instead.

In addition to these stylesheets, the root project imports the `src/index.css` file, so its styles are used for every example. Be sure to take a look at this file: you may find some of these styles necessary in your own usage of the `<Tldraw/>` component.

### HTML

You probably also want to update your `index.html`'s meta viewport element as shown below. 

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
```

These may not be critical to `<Tldraw/>` performing correctly, however some features (such as safe area positioning) may not work correctly if these are not set.


## Server Rendering

The `<Tldraw/>` component cannot be server-rendered. If you're using the component in a server-rendered framework (such as Next.js) then you will need to import it dynamically. Check the [examples repository](https://github.com/tldraw/examples) to see examples.

## Going deeper

If you wanted to have more granular control, you could also use those lower-level components directly. See [this example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/apps/examples/src/5-exploded/ExplodedExample.tsx) for reference.
